I love [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/). It's been the task manager I've trusted and used for years, partly because the design makes using the app so enjoyable. I wanted to bring that same joy to Obsidian by creating a Things-inspired design that looked and felt native on MacOS and iOS.

## Features

- Things-inspired color palette
- Light and dark theme
- Quick preview/edit floating action button on mobile
- Customizable colors for bold, italic, highlighters, and block-quotes
- Atom code syntax higlighting
- Tag pills for readability
- Minimal icons
- Better designed image cards
- Bullet and number list relationship lines
- Fancy cursor based on Things cursor color
- Publish and Sync support
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font and ligatures for code

## Credits

Again, I owe a huge hat tip to **@kepano** and his Minimal Theme, which served as the base for this theme, as well as to **@chetachiezikeuzor** and her Yin and Yang Theme for further inspiration on building an elegant, native-feeling design!
